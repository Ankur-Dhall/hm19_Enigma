Project Idea: Waste management

A machine learning based project to predict whether a garbage item is bidegradable or non-biodegradable.

We trained our own Artificial Neural Network and SVM. 

We also used pre-trained models, VGG16 and ResNet, available in Keras which won ImageNet competitions in 2013 and 2015 respectively.

Accuracy:
  SVM=~71%
  VGG16=~75%
